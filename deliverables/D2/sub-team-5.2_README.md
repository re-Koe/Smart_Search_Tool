# README

This is the readme file for subteam 2 where we'll quickly run over how to get up and running with our section of the code. The steps are essentially identical to other subteams however if you haven't visited those yet then these instructions will prove to be useful.

In order to test our code on subteam 2, please follow these steps:

## OPTION 1:

1. Clone the repository and open up the project in an IDE of your choice (Our preference is VS Code)
2. Navigate to the project directory by doing `cd app` in the terminal.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. In a browser of your chocie open up localhost:5173 and you should see the website
6. Navigate to the smart search screen and click view results.
7. Verify the following functionalities:
   - Toggle between card view and table view of results.
   - Click on a result to open the details modal.
   - Within the modal, test image cycling and property information display.
   - Test swiping between results in the modal view (this can be done by hovering you mouse on the far left and far right of the screen)
