## Product Details

#### Q1: What is the product?

Our product is an intuitive front-end interface for a smart search tool, combining a chatbot and interactive mapping to enable realtors to discover properties that precisely meet their clients' unique requirements.

Realtors often struggle to convert leads into clients because traditional property search platforms lack the ability to filter listings based on very specific criteria. Clients may have unique preferences—such as wanting a home that faces west to enjoy sunsets—that are not easily accommodated by standard search tools. This gap makes it challenging for realtors to satisfy client needs and close deals. Smart Search Tool is a chatbot that will be helping realtors filter the homes considering that it will be provided with the necessary options. To be more specific, the realtor will ask “apartments with big balconies in Annex Area” to the chatbot and the chatbot will show the location of possible options on the map.

We will relate interactions of the user with the smart search bot to the map so that the user will have a better understanding of what they are asking for. Our partner for this project is Realtime Homes which is a startup of University of Toronto students. The product is the feature of the website. Our partner has backend for the smart search tool we are asked to only build the front end. We were given the picture below to see what is expected from us to build:

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target users are realtors in Canada who are seeking advanced tools to meet specific client demands.

Persona: Mike

Mike is a 35-year-old realtor based in Toronto, Canada. With five years of experience in the real estate industry, he is dedicated to providing exceptional service to his clients. Mike often encounters buyers who have very specific requirements for their ideal homes—such as a bedroom that gets sunlight throughout the day.

Traditional property search platforms lack the detailed filtering options Mike needs to fulfill these unique client requests. This limitation makes it challenging for him to efficiently find suitable listings, potentially causing missed opportunities to close deals.

By utilizing our product, Mike can quickly locate homes that align with his clients' exact preferences. This empowers him to convert more leads into satisfied clients, enhancing his reputation and success in the competitive real estate market.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Our product enhances the filtering system to be more detailed, precisely matching home seekers' preferences. By including a map feature, it makes home search results more practical and accessible. Unlike the competitors, our product caters to specific client desires that are hard to quantify such as a "big" living room. This perfectly aligns with our partner organization's mission: enabling detailed searches, providing accurate results, and helping realtors convert leads into clients.

#### Q4: What are the user stories that make up the Minumum Viable Product (MVP)?

## Intellectual Property Confidentiality Agreement

## We will only reference the work we did in your resume, interviews, etc. We agree to not share the code or software in any capacity with anyone unless our partner has agreed to it.

## Teamwork Details

#### Q6: Have you met with your team?

We met a few times online and once in person to get bubble tea near campus on Bloor Street. We didn't take any pictures as we met around the second week. We also played some browser games after the meeting. We use our group chat in Discord not only for the project but also to talk about other stuff (But everything is organized so it doesn't affect the work!)
*We are 6 people from 5 different countries
*Some of us have past professional experiences working with our current tech stack, while some of us have no experience, so we will help each other learn
\*We have 2 third year and 4 fourth-year students

#### Q7: What are the roles & responsibilities on the team?

- partner liaison: Responsible for communications with the partner, TA, and professor.
- lead: responsible for organizing the tasks, taking notes during the meeting, and making decisions when there is no majority agreement, following piazza and course announcements.
- Mentor Developer: Developers who have experience with our tech stack, should help other developers with learning.
- Developer: Mainly responsible for learning our tech stack and implementing their part in the project.
- Designer: Designs the UI/UX, creates mockups
- Tech Consultant: Has the most experience in our current tech stack, helps with technical problems, and provides solutions.

- Sridhar [partner liaison] [Developer]: He is new to web development, but really eager to learn. He is great at communication and organization, so he is also a partner liaison.
- Ege [lead][Mentor Developer]: Wants to improve his project management and leadership skills. He has some experience with react, so he will help with teaching the basics.
- Marton [Mentor Developer][Designer]: He has extensive experience with front end and design tools like Figma. He took 318 before so he has the experience to be a designer.
- Ozgen [partner liaison] [Developer] He is new to our current tech stack, but he has been learning it. He manages his time well and is really responsible, so he is also a partner liaison.
- Kowshik [Mentor Developer] Has full-stack experience, working on implementations and helping others to learn the tech stack.
- Nicholas [Mentor Developer][Tech Consultant] Really experienced with both our tech stack and other technologies, both practically and theoritically.

#### Q8: How will you work as a team?

We are doing meetings whenever there is a need or demand. We are planning to have a social meeting soon to hang out. We are having our meetings mostly on discord. We are always communicating asynchronously on our discord server. We meet with our partner weekly on Thursday evenings. We also meet as a team online right after the partner meetings to discuss the meeting.

#### Q9: How will you organize your team?

We are using the Discord server and a [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/66f068dedf9759b27f4943e1/ATTI76b18bc947e27a521fccef23b1fe0d01C0870C6C/csc301) to organize the tasks. We first divide the work into manageable chunks and then assign the chunks evenly.

#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?

We have a team channel on Discord where the team members communicate all the time, but we also have another server with the partner. We use both email and discord server to communicate with the partner.

When a member is not responsive, we try to get in touch with them to learn the reason. If we fail to get in touch, we will just divide their work among us to meet the deadlines. If that member comes back later, they would have slightly more work assigned to them than others to make up for the missed work. If they are still unresponsive, no tasks will be assigned to them and this will be noted and reported. If they have a valid reason for not being able to complete the work, we will either try to help them finish the work or assign their work to the rest of the group without a penalty.

## Organisation Details

#### Q11. How does your team fit within the overall team organisation of the partner?

We will primarily focus on product development for the frontend, using the rough outline given to us into a more refined and user-friendly interface. The partner's backend is already established, including components like SmartTMA (which helps calculate the right price for homes) and SmartReports (a reporting tool). However, the frontend isn’t fully developed, and the user interface needs improvements to ensure ease of use and extendability. Our team’s role in this project is building the frontend for the Minimum Viable Product. Since we’ll focus on converting designs into an actual frontend with essential features like a map, chat, and filter system, our team fits into the product development and UX/UI enhancement aspect of the overall team structure.

Examples of why we fit this role:

- We are tasked with developing the SmartSearch frontend (map, chat and filters), they have a design prototype but nothing implemented for the SmartSearch
- Our team will ensure the code adheres to best practices and is extendable for future development.
- Since we are focusing on the design aspect and have to make the UI more appealing, our role is more aligned with improving product usability.

#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?

Our project fits into the overall product as the core frontend component that integrates with the backend’s machine learning functionalities. The backend, which includes SmartTMA and SmartReports, performs tasks such as comparing homes and generating reports, but these need a frontend for user interaction. Our project is building the frontend for the MVP, making it the first step toward turning the partner’s work into a user friendly and market ready product. The UI we build will allow realtors to interact with backend services (like inputing a home and geting details about it or comparing it to another home). Without a functional and good looking frontend, the backend capabilities cannot be fully displayed or used by the target users (realtors and brokerages). The partner’s team focuses on backend development using FastAPI for APIs and machine learning algorithms. Our team will handle the frontend development, while future extensions (such as adding features for authentication) will depend on the work we finish during this MVP stage.

## Potential Risks

#### Q13. What are some potential risks to your project?

There are quite a few possible risks that we might have, especially at this planning stage,
but with good communication between the team and the partner, we should be able to resolve them.
Here are some possible risks:

1. Scope Creep
   This would be when working on the project, more and more tasks are added to the scope of the project.
   As more tasks are added, the likelyhood of being able to accomplish and complete the project
   by the end of the course (CSC301) would decrease.
2. Insufficient Details in User Stories
   In detailing user stories, we might not have created a robust enough user story
   with a full amount of details. This insuffiency of details would cause us to have
   an issue when dealing with implementing the finer details of the product.
3. Lack of Consistent Communication with Client
   Trying to communicate and stay on the same page on the client is important so that
   if there are any clarifications that need be made, they can be quickly made
   and resolved so that blockers can be cleared and more work can be done.
4. Lack of ML Chatbot Information
   One of the major selling points of the product is the interactive chatbot.
   Our task is to work on, majorly, the front end of the product,
   and the client will be working on the ML chatbot aspect of the project.
   In order to integrate the front end and the chatbot, we will need to know a
   decent amount of how the chatbot would be integrated into the front end.
   Without that, we would have issues knowing how to implement finer details
   of the project.

#### Q14. What are some potential mitigation strategies for the risks you identified?

For these risks, here are some possible mitigation strategies for each risk:

1. Scope Creep
   By clearly discussing and defining the scope of the project at the beginning of the project,
   having regular meetings to discuss our progress and adjust our goals accordingly,
   we should not have issues in regards to a creeping scope.
2. Insufficient Details in User Stories
   Discussing our user stories with the client will allow us to understand
   to what depth of detail our stories must be and how that will guide us
   in creating the project.
3. Lack of Consistent Communication with Client
   By having a regular means of communication that everyone can keep up with,
   it would allow us to have easy communication for both simple and quick questions,
   as well as larger and more complex problems.
   We will be creating a Discord server for the client and the team to use
   so that communication between everyone is transparant, easy to catch-up on,
   and quick.
4. Lack of ML Chatbot Information
   Discussing with the client about any questions regarding the Chatbot
   we might have and resolving them as we come would clear up this problem.
   As mentioned prior, our Discord server would solve this problem.
